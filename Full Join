#FULL JOIN - The FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either the left or the right table. If there's no match, NULL values will appear in the columns where the match is missing.

SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
